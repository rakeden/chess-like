   - Created a new `PreparationTimer` component to display the countdown
   - Added visual feedback with color changes as time decreases
   - Included a "Ready" button to manually complete preparation early

   - Implemented board rotation based on player color (white/black)
   - Added visual distinctions between player and opponent pieces

5. **UI Flow Improvements:**
   - Modified the game layout to show/hide components based on game phase
   - Added game phase-specific instructions and feedback
   - Improved the piece selection to only be available during preparation

### Next Steps:
- Implement piece movement logic for the playing phase
- Add rules for piece capturing and interactions
- Create victory/defeat conditions
- Implement opponent AI for automatic moves
- Add visual effects for piece movements and captures
- Create additional puzzles with varying difficulty levels

### Tech Details:
- Used React's Context API for game state management across components
- Implemented automatic game phase transitions with useEffect hooks
- Created responsive UI components using shadcn/ui
- Maintained separation between 3D rendering (Three.js) and UI elements
