# Chess Application Development Log

## Overview
This document contains the development log for the chess application, tracking progress, decisions, and implementation details.

## Components
### ChessPiece Component
The `ChessPiece.jsx` component handles:
- 3D rendering of chess pieces using Three.js
- Drag and drop interactions
- Piece movement with snapping to valid board positions
- Visual feedback (highlighting) when pieces are moved out of bounds
- Animation effects for piece movements

Key features implemented:
- Fallback pieces when 3D models fail to load
- Shadows underneath dragged pieces
- Piece removal when dragged off the board
- Hover effects for better user interaction
- Position snapping to align with board squares

#### Out-of-Bounds Behavior
When pieces are dragged outside the board boundaries:
- Visual feedback shows red highlighting/tinting on the piece
- A custom event 'piece-out-of-bounds' is dispatched
- Upon release, the piece falls off the board with an acceleration effect
- A 'piece-removed' event is dispatched with piece details
- The piece animates with the following enhanced effects:
  - Accelerated falling using quadratic easing
  - Slight random movement in x and z directions for realistic physics
  - Random rotation as it falls
  - Scaling down to zero for a disappearing effect
  - Animation duration increased to 800ms for smoother effect
- Console logs record the removal: "Removed [color] [type] from the board"

## Enhancement Log

### 2023-10-XX: Improved Piece Removal Animation
Enhanced the animation when pieces are removed from the board:
- Implemented accelerated falling using quadratic easing function
- Added slight random movement along x and z axes for more realistic physics
- Added random rotation as pieces fall off the board
- Replaced opacity fade with scaling to zero for a more dramatic disappearing effect
- Increased animation duration from 500ms to 800ms for a smoother effect

These changes make the piece removal more visually appealing and provide better feedback to the user when pieces are dragged out of bounds.

### 2023-10-XX: Fixed Shadow Persistence Bug
Fixed an issue where the drag shadow would remain visible when a piece was removed from the board:
- Added an `isRemoved` state variable to track when pieces are removed
- Updated the `DragShadow` component to hide when a piece is removed
- This ensures that no visual artifacts remain after a piece is removed from the board

### 2023-10-XX: Added Piece Tray Feature
Implemented a piece tray in front of the chessboard:
- Created a `PieceTray` component that displays 5 neutral squares with chess pieces
- Added white pawn, knight, bishop, rook, and queen pieces to the tray
- Tray pieces are rendered at half the size of regular board pieces
- When dragged onto the board, tray pieces grow to full size
- Added custom event handling to manage piece transitions
- Pieces can be repeatedly dragged from the tray to create multiple instances

Implementation details:
- New `PieceTray` component with neutral colored squares
- Added `isTrayPiece` and `scale` properties to the `ChessPiece` component
- Enhanced drag and drop behavior to detect when pieces move from tray to board
- Added animation for size transition using React Spring
- Used custom event 'tray-piece-placed' to notify the Scene when new pieces are added

### 2023-10-XX: Fixed Duplicate Piece Rendering Bug
Fixed an issue where pieces from the tray were being rendered twice when placed on the board:
- Added a `hideOriginal` state variable to hide the original tray piece after placement
- Added a refresh mechanism in the `PieceTray` component to create new pieces
- Used a counter in the tray to generate unique keys for each new piece
- Implemented conditional rendering to prevent visual duplication
- Original tray pieces are now hidden while their copies are added to the board as new pieces

This ensures a clean user experience with no visual artifacts when dragging pieces from the tray to the board.

### 2023-10-XX: Enhanced Tray Piece Removal
Improved the piece tray functionality to allow direct removal of pieces:
- Added the ability to discard pieces from the tray without first placing them on the board
- Implemented distance-based logic to detect intentional discarding vs accidental out-of-bounds
- Pieces dragged far enough from the tray (distance > 2 units) are treated as discarded
- Used the same falling and disappearing animation as regular piece removal
- Pieces dragged slightly out of bounds will return to their original tray position
- Added console logging for tray piece discard actions

This enhancement provides a more intuitive user experience by allowing unwanted pieces to be discarded directly from the tray.

### 2023-10-XX: Removed FallbackPiece Component
Simplified the chess piece rendering by removing the fallback implementation:
- Removed the entire `FallbackPiece` component that was used as a substitute when 3D models failed to load
- Modified the rendering logic to only show pieces when their 3D models are properly loaded
- Simplified the conditional rendering in the return statement
- Removed references to the `loadError` state in the rendering process
- Kept the warning logs when model loading fails for debugging purposes

This change streamlines the codebase by removing unused fallback functionality, as the 3D models are now reliably loaded from the preloaded model store.

### 2023-10-XX: Improved Piece Tray Position and Size
Adjusted the piece tray to enhance usability and aesthetics:
- Moved the tray closer to the board (distance reduced from 4.5 to 3 units)
- Reduced the spacing between tray pieces (from 1.0 to 0.8 units)
- Made the tray platforms smaller (reduced from 0.8×0.8 to 0.6×0.6 units)
- Updated the piece removal detection logic to match the new tray position
- Reduced the distance threshold for piece discarding (from 2.0 to 1.5 units)

These adjustments create a more compact and cohesive look, making it easier for users to drag pieces from the tray to the board with less movement required.

### 2023-10-XX: Added Piece Appearance Animation
Implemented animated entrance effects for chess pieces when they first appear:
- Created different animations for board pieces and tray pieces
- Board pieces fade in, scale up from zero, and rise before settling to final position
- Tray pieces rise slightly and then settle to their position
- Added staggered timing so pieces appear in sequence rather than all at once
- Used setTimeout with random delay factors for natural-looking staggered animation
- Implemented smoother animation with custom spring physics (friction, tension, mass)
- Configured tray pieces to appear in left-to-right order with 150ms delay between each

Technical implementation:
- Modified the useSpring configuration to start with zero scale and opacity for board pieces
- Added entryDelay prop to ChessPiece component for controlled timing
- Enhanced PieceTray component to pass incremental delays to each piece
- Used a two-phase animation: first rising/scaling, then settling to final position
- Set different animation parameters for tray pieces vs. board pieces

This enhancement adds visual polish to the application and provides better feedback when the board is initially set up or when pieces are added.

### 2023-10-XX: Refined Piece Appearance Animation
Made the piece appearance animation more subtle and professional:
- Reduced vertical movement during appearance animation (from 0.3 to 0.15 units for board pieces)
- Reduced vertical movement for tray pieces (from 0.2 to 0.1 units)
- Decreased the delay between tray pieces (from 150ms to 80ms) for a smoother sequence
- Shortened the animation duration for a crisper, more responsive feel
- Adjusted physics parameters for more natural motion:
  - Increased friction values to reduce oscillation
  - Lowered tension values for gentler acceleration
  - Added mass parameters to improve stability
  - Reduced random delay factors for more consistent timing

These refinements create a more polished, subtle appearance effect that maintains visual feedback without being distracting. The pieces now appear with a gentle, professional animation that enhances the user experience while being less obtrusive.

### 2023-10-XX: Accelerated Piece Appearance Animation
Doubled the speed of the piece appearance animation for a snappier, more responsive feel:
- Cut all animation timings in half:
  - Reduced settling time from 150ms to 75ms for tray pieces
  - Reduced settling time from 200ms to 100ms for board pieces
  - Decreased staggered delay between tray pieces from 80ms to 40ms
  - Reduced random delay component from 100ms to 50ms
- Modified spring physics for faster movement:
  - Lowered friction values (from 18→12 for tray pieces, 20→14 for board pieces)
  - Increased tension values (from 120→180 for tray pieces, 140→210 for board pieces)
  - Reduced mass parameters (from 1.2→0.8 for tray pieces, 1.7→1.0 for board pieces)
- Maintained the same visual effect but with twice the speed

These changes result in a more immediate visual response when the game starts or when new pieces are added to the board, creating a snappier, more responsive feel while preserving the polished appearance effect.
