# Chess Application Development Log

## Overview
This document contains the development log for the chess application, tracking progress, decisions, and implementation details.

## Components
### ChessPiece Component
The `ChessPiece.jsx` component handles:
- 3D rendering of chess pieces using Three.js
- Drag and drop interactions
- Piece movement with snapping to valid board positions
- Visual feedback (highlighting) when pieces are moved out of bounds
- Animation effects for piece movements

Key features implemented:
- Fallback pieces when 3D models fail to load
- Shadows underneath dragged pieces
- Piece removal when dragged off the board
- Hover effects for better user interaction
- Position snapping to align with board squares

#### Out-of-Bounds Behavior
When pieces are dragged outside the board boundaries:
- Visual feedback shows red highlighting/tinting on the piece
- A custom event 'piece-out-of-bounds' is dispatched
- Upon release, the piece falls off the board with an acceleration effect
- A 'piece-removed' event is dispatched with piece details
- The piece animates with the following enhanced effects:
  - Accelerated falling using quadratic easing
  - Slight random movement in x and z directions for realistic physics
  - Random rotation as it falls
  - Scaling down to zero for a disappearing effect
  - Animation duration increased to 800ms for smoother effect
- Console logs record the removal: "Removed [color] [type] from the board"

## Enhancement Log

### 2023-10-XX: Improved Piece Removal Animation
Enhanced the animation when pieces are removed from the board:
- Implemented accelerated falling using quadratic easing function
- Added slight random movement along x and z axes for more realistic physics
- Added random rotation as pieces fall off the board
- Replaced opacity fade with scaling to zero for a more dramatic disappearing effect
- Increased animation duration from 500ms to 800ms for a smoother effect

These changes make the piece removal more visually appealing and provide better feedback to the user when pieces are dragged out of bounds.

### 2023-10-XX: Fixed Shadow Persistence Bug
Fixed an issue where the drag shadow would remain visible when a piece was removed from the board:
- Added an `isRemoved` state variable to track when pieces are removed
- Updated the `DragShadow` component to hide when a piece is removed
- This ensures that no visual artifacts remain after a piece is removed from the board

### 2023-10-XX: Added Piece Tray Feature
Implemented a piece tray in front of the chessboard:
- Created a `PieceTray` component that displays 5 neutral squares with chess pieces
- Added white pawn, knight, bishop, rook, and queen pieces to the tray
- Tray pieces are rendered at half the size of regular board pieces
- When dragged onto the board, tray pieces grow to full size
- Added custom event handling to manage piece transitions
- Pieces can be repeatedly dragged from the tray to create multiple instances

Implementation details:
- New `PieceTray` component with neutral colored squares
- Added `isTrayPiece` and `scale` properties to the `ChessPiece` component
- Enhanced drag and drop behavior to detect when pieces move from tray to board
- Added animation for size transition using React Spring
- Used custom event 'tray-piece-placed' to notify the Scene when new pieces are added

### 2023-10-XX: Fixed Duplicate Piece Rendering Bug
Fixed an issue where pieces from the tray were being rendered twice when placed on the board:
- Added a `hideOriginal` state variable to hide the original tray piece after placement
- Added a refresh mechanism in the `PieceTray` component to create new pieces
- Used a counter in the tray to generate unique keys for each new piece
- Implemented conditional rendering to prevent visual duplication
- Original tray pieces are now hidden while their copies are added to the board as new pieces

This ensures a clean user experience with no visual artifacts when dragging pieces from the tray to the board.

### 2023-10-XX: Enhanced Tray Piece Removal
Improved the piece tray functionality to allow direct removal of pieces:
- Added the ability to discard pieces from the tray without first placing them on the board
- Implemented distance-based logic to detect intentional discarding vs accidental out-of-bounds
- Pieces dragged far enough from the tray (distance > 2 units) are treated as discarded
- Used the same falling and disappearing animation as regular piece removal
- Pieces dragged slightly out of bounds will return to their original tray position
- Added console logging for tray piece discard actions

This enhancement provides a more intuitive user experience by allowing unwanted pieces to be discarded directly from the tray.
