# Chess Application Development Log

## Overview
This document contains the development log for the chess application, tracking progress, decisions, and implementation details.

## Components
### ChessPiece Component
The `ChessPiece.jsx` component handles:
- 3D rendering of chess pieces using Three.js
- Drag and drop interactions
- Piece movement with snapping to valid board positions
- Visual feedback (highlighting) when pieces are moved out of bounds
- Animation effects for piece movements

Key features implemented:
- Fallback pieces when 3D models fail to load
- Shadows underneath dragged pieces
- Piece removal when dragged off the board
- Hover effects for better user interaction
- Position snapping to align with board squares

#### Out-of-Bounds Behavior
When pieces are dragged outside the board boundaries:
- Visual feedback shows red highlighting/tinting on the piece
- A custom event 'piece-out-of-bounds' is dispatched
- Upon release, the piece falls off the board with an acceleration effect
- A 'piece-removed' event is dispatched with piece details
- The piece animates with the following enhanced effects:
  - Accelerated falling using quadratic easing
  - Slight random movement in x and z directions for realistic physics
  - Random rotation as it falls
  - Scaling down to zero for a disappearing effect
  - Animation duration increased to 800ms for smoother effect
- Console logs record the removal: "Removed [color] [type] from the board"

## Enhancement Log

### 2023-10-XX: Improved Piece Removal Animation
Enhanced the animation when pieces are removed from the board:
- Implemented accelerated falling using quadratic easing function
- Added slight random movement along x and z axes for more realistic physics
- Added random rotation as pieces fall off the board
- Replaced opacity fade with scaling to zero for a more dramatic disappearing effect
- Increased animation duration from 500ms to 800ms for a smoother effect

These changes make the piece removal more visually appealing and provide better feedback to the user when pieces are dragged out of bounds.
