# Chess Application Development Log

## Overview
This document contains the development log for the chess application, tracking progress, decisions, and implementation details.

## Components
### ChessPiece Component
The `ChessPiece.jsx` component handles:
- 3D rendering of chess pieces using Three.js
- Drag and drop interactions
- Piece movement with snapping to valid board positions
- Visual feedback (highlighting) when pieces are moved out of bounds
- Animation effects for piece movements

Key features implemented:
- Fallback pieces when 3D models fail to load
- Shadows underneath dragged pieces
- Piece removal when dragged off the board
- Hover effects for better user interaction
- Position snapping to align with board squares
